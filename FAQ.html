<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">About TEDxRUET</h3>
<br>
<p id="ques_bold">1. What are TEDx events? How is TEDxRUET connected to TED?</p>
<p>TEDx events are independently organized ‘in the spirit of ideas worth spreading’ in a locality to share a similar experience to <font style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">TED</font> Talks with inspiring speakers, captivating talks and invigorating ideas under license and guidance provided by the <font style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">TED</font> authorities. <font style="color: black; font-weight: bold;">TEDxRUET</font> is RUET’s effort to bring our community together and stimulate bright, curious minds the way <font style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">TED</font> Talks have done for years.</p>

<p id="ques_bold">2. How is TEDxRUET funded? </p>
<p>TEDxRUET is a completely volunteer-run non-profit event where all of the funding comes from either the ticket the attendees need to purchase or from sponsors who share our views and encourage us to pursue it. No monetary transaction takes place between <font style="color: black; font-weight: bold;">TEDxRUET</font> and <font style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">TED</font>.</p>

<p id="ques_bold">3. When is TEDxRUET going to take place?</p>
<p>If all goes well, the <font style="color: black; font-weight: bold;">TEDxRUET</font> should take place as a daylong event (from 10 am to 5 pm) on the 15th February of 2019.</p>

<p id="ques_bold">4. What is going to be the theme for the upcoming event?</p>

<p id="ques_bold">2. Does the sponsorship only include money?</p>
<p>No, sponsorship in the form of supplying necessary products for the events, as well as food and residency for the speakers are also accepted.</p>

<p id="ques_bold">3. What would be done with the surplus that might come from the sponsorship money?</p>
<p>We hope to continue on with these events, so any surplus that may remain will be put to use for the upcoming events. No one related to the organizing this event will be benefitted from it in any way.</p>

<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Volunteers And The Organizing Committee</h3>
<br>
<p id="ques_bold">1. Whom was the License for <font style="color: black; font-weight: bold;">TEDxRUET</font> issued to?</p>
<p><font style="color: black; font-weight: bold;">Md Yeasin Khan</font>, (CE’13, RUET) had been in pursuit of the license from the October of 2017. Finally after being granted license a committed team of volunteers started working towards organizing a truly memorable event.</p>

<p id="ques_bold">2. Can anyone be a volunteer?</p>
<p>Primary selection for the event has already been done. Any student from RUET was allowed to apply to be a volunteer. The ones who were selected were assigned to teams according to their areas of expertise to make the best use of our resources.</p>

<p id="ques_bold">3. What are the benefits of volunteering for <font style="color: black; font-weight: bold;">TEDxRUET</font>? Are the volunteers paid?</p>
<p>The volunteers working here gain experience and learn team-building while working in cohesion to achieve a common goal. Social connections and skills acquired through the process of organizing such a large-scale event is invaluable as well. However, among the countless perks of volunteering for <font style="color: black; font-weight: bold;">TEDxRUET</font>, financial gain is not included. Certificates are to be provided for volunteers, as well as T-shirts and goody bags during the event.</p>
